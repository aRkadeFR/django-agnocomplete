============================
Django Agnostic Autocomplete
============================

Heavily based on `django-autcomplete-light <https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/>`_ workflow and concepts, this toolkit offers a front-end agnostic way to get fields for autocompletion.

It will provide:

* a simple and configurable entry-point management,
* a REST-like HTTP API to search for results,
* Fields and widgets that will make the interface between our Django code and *your* Javascript.

Install
=======

At the moment, it's only a manual install::

    pip install -e ./
